#Mobber - Pixel Perfection
**An excercise using HTML & CSS** 

This was our first assignment in class. We were given a mockup of a website. Our goal was to recreate the mockup as close to pixel perfection as possible. The second part of the assignment was to go back and add hover states that would follow the general aesthetics of the design.
